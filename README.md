# Gesture_recognition

The project is based on developing a model for a smart-TV that can accurately identify the five gestures of the user to control the TV settings.
The gestures given below refer to these corresponding commands:
•	Thumbs up: Increase the volume
•	Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
•	Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
•	Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
•	Stop: Pause the movie
Each video consists of a sequence of 30 frames.

Look into the Gesture_recognition_project.docx for more details on the various models used for this project.
